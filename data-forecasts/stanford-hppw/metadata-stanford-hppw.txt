team_model_designation: primary
methods: Choice between XGBoostLSS negative binomial regression model with only year/month information, a more complex model including past and predicted weather data, and a baseline negative binomial model.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false 
data_inputs: WNV neuroinvasive cases in previous year (CDC), PRISM monthly-averaged weather data, US Census (population), NCEP seasonal forecasts (downloaded from Copernicus).
methods_long: "The best performing model for each state and month was chosen between 1) a baseline negative binomial model, 2) an XGBoostLSS negative binomial regression model including only state population, month and year information and 3) an XGBoostLSS negative binomial regression model including the previous variables, as well as past weather and predicted weather. Various models were fit with different combinations of weather variables, including mean and maximum monthly air temperature, precipitation and vapor pressure deficit averaged at the state level from the previous year. These data were included both as 12, 13 and 14 month lagged variables and as seasonal averages (spring, summer, autumn, winter). For months where they were available, we also included predicted mean temperature, maximum temperature and precipitation according to the NOAA seasonal forecasts both for the predicted month and 1, 2 and 3 month lagged variables. Weather variables were summarized for every state with a weighted mean, where the weights were based on estimated human population and species distribution models for Culex pipiens, quinquefasciatus and tarsalis at every pixel."
