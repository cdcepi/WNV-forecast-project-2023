ensemble_of_hub_models: false
methods: Quantiles from state-month-specific negative binomial fit to 2005-2022 historical WNV data (2022 data was provisional at time of creation)
data_inputs: state-month counts of WNV cases
methods_long: This is a baseline model created from 2005-2022 historical WNV reported case counts. A state-month-specific negative binomial distribution was fit to the historical data and quantiles calculated based on the empirically determined distribution parameters. State-months with no historical cases were supplied quantiles based on a heavily zero-weighted Bayesian fit.
