team_model_designation: primary
methods: A temporal fusion transformer was trained for each state to make 5 month ahead quantile predictions. Several tranformer models were trained with varying exogenous parameters, including national counts and predicted values from logistic fitting.
ensemble_of_hub_models: false
data_inputs: Various NOAA monthly weather data is used(average temperature, max temperature, min temperature, precipitation, z-index etc.) per state. Cyclical temporal inputs are used. Wikipedia site data is also used.
